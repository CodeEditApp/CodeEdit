# File Management

Working with files and directories in CodeEdit.

## Overview

CodeEdit manages files using three classes:
- ``CEWorkspaceFile`` for representing files and other file system objects.
- ``CEWorkspaceFileManager`` for loading, modifying, and listening to the file system.
- ``CodeFileDocument`` for loading contents of files for editing.
